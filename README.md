# threejs-angular test

## Prerequisites

You must have Node.js >= 15.12.0 and MongoDB >= 5.0.0 installed in your system.

## Installation / quick start

run `npm install`
if error about dependency resolution is shown, try `npm i --force`.

run `npx ng serve` to start development server. navigate to http://localhost:4200/

run `npx ng build --prod` to build production version of app.
run `npm serve` to start node server. Application will be served on http://localhost:8081/

## TODO

The app state is successfully exported and saved on server,
but loading the scene from JSON doesn't work in full as intended.
This will hopefully be fixed soon.
